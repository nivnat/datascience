# Tech Mahindra - Data Science Internship 

Wroked for a large multinational public sector bank client, as a Data Analyst intern to analyze their internet banking login data. I chose a test data set of all login attempts during the last 6 months and applied the following machine learning algorithms (in python):

1) Linear regression - univariate cost function analysis
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) K-means clustering
5) Classification - Logistic regression

The most important features used to work with different algorithms were :
- Login Status: LoginSuccess, Invalid Login failure, Duplicate session login failure, Restriced IP login failure
- Age: Predicted that people of age 30 years and above are prone to more login failure attempts

LINEAR REGRESSION:

To find if the variables had any correlation to number of login attempts. There were certain outliers so age as an additional feature was chosen to check if that makes a difference in prediction.

DECISION TREE

Decided that Age and gender as features would be a better way to predict failures, but realized that Gender wasn't captured during the production stage, so abandoned decision tree
